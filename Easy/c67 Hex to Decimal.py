'''HEX TO DECIMAL

You will be given a hexadecimal (base 16) number. Convert it into decimal (base
10).

INPUT SAMPLE:
Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line
in this file contains a hex number. You may assume that the hex number does not
have the leading 'Ox'. Also all alpha characters (a through f) in the input will
be in lowercase. E.g.

9f
11

OUTPUT SAMPLE:
Print out the equivalent decimal number. E.g.

159
17
'''
def f(test='9f'):
    print(int(test.rstrip(), 16))
