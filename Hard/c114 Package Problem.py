'''PACKAGE PROBLEM

You want to send your friend a package with different things.
Each thing you put inside the package has such parameters as index number,
weight and cost.
The package has a weight limit.
Your goal is to determine which things to put into the package so that the total
weight is less than or equal to the package limit and the total cost is as large
as possible.

You would prefer to send a package which weights less in case there is more than
one package with the same price.

INPUT SAMPLE:
Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. The input
file contains several lines. Each line is one test case.

Each line contains the weight that the package can take (before the colon) and
the list of things you need to choose. Each thing is enclosed in parentheses
where the 1st number is a thing's index number, the 2nd is its weight and the
3rd is its cost. E.g.

81 : (1,53.38,$45) (2,88.62,$98) (3,78.48,$3) (4,72.30,$76) (5,30.18,$9) (6,46.34,$48)
8 : (1,15.3,$34)
75 : (1,85.31,$29) (2,14.55,$74) (3,3.98,$16) (4,26.24,$55) (5,63.69,$52) (6,76.25,$75) (7,60.02,$74) (8,93.18,$35) (9,89.95,$78)
56 : (1,90.72,$13) (2,33.80,$40) (3,43.15,$10) (4,37.97,$16) (5,46.81,$36) (6,48.77,$79) (7,81.80,$45) (8,19.36,$79) (9,6.76,$64)

OUTPUT SAMPLE:
For each set of things that you put into the package provide a list (itemsâ€™
index numbers are separated by comma). E.g.

4
-
2,7
8,9
