'''STRING SEARCHING

You are given two strings. Determine if the second string is a substring of the
first (Do NOT use any substr type library function). The second string may
contain an asterisk(*) which should be treated as a regular expression i.e.
matches zero or more characters. The asterisk can be escaped by a \ char in
which case it should be interpreted as a regular '*' character. To summarize:
the strings can contain alphabets, numbers, * and \ characters.

INPUT SAMPLE:
Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. The input
file contains two comma delimited strings per line. E.g.

Hello,ell
This is good, is
CodeEval,C*Eval
Old,Young

OUTPUT SAMPLE:
If the second string is indeed a substring of the first, print out a 'true'
(lowercase), else print out a 'false'(lowercase), one per line. E.g.

true
true
true
false
'''
import re
def f(test):
    string, sub = test.rstrip('\n').split(',')
    sub = sub.strip()
    escaped = False
    rgx = ''
    for char in sub:
        if char == '\\' and escaped == False:
            escaped = True
        elif escaped:
            escaped = False
            if char == '*':
                rgx+= '\\*'
            else:
                rgx+= char
        elif char == '*' :
            rgx+= '.*'
        else:
            rgx+= char
    print('true') if re.search(rgx, string) else print('false')
