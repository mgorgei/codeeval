'''STRING PERMUTATIONS

Write a program which prints all the permutations of a string in alphabetical
order. We consider that digits < upper case letters < lower case letters. The
sorting should be performed in ascending order.

INPUT SAMPLE:
Your program should accept a file as its first argument. The file contains input
strings, one per line.
For example:

hat
abc
Zu6

OUTPUT SAMPLE:
Print to stdout the permutations of the string separated by comma, in
alphabetical order.
For example:

aht,ath,hat,hta,tah,tha
abc,acb,bac,bca,cab,cba
6Zu,6uZ,Z6u,Zu6,u6Z,uZ6

from itertools import permutations
def f(test):
    print(','.join( [''.join(item) for item in sorted(permutations(test.rstrip('\n')))] ))
